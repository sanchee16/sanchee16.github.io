**For life is such a dream** <br>
**Let the flight take off, enjoy the journey** <br>
**So that when you go for finishing line** <br>
**That smile you bear is the one remembered.** <br>

Interestingly, I am a geek. A coder by profession, an event manager by passion, a fun lover and a technology enthusiast who loves to explore new things. 

Recently, I have realised that I really want to go ahead in field of machine learning, well ***deep learning*** to be specifc. Additionally, I am really crazy about ***nanotechnology*** as the next gen tech.

But life has various dimensions which makes me go with varied stuff and not only tech related things. So,I like ***traveling*** which is still an unfulfilled dream. Well,travelling makes people think of Himalyas but guess what- I have always cherished its beauty since my birth.It is this nature that drove me to ***reading and writing*** and made me believe that writing is an art I must use for realizing my inner self and true opinions. 

There is another part of personality that I love - ***My food habits. I experiment, I cook and I eat***. The satisfaction of having great food is the best joy in life.

As for what and who inspire me are ***ted talks, ink talks and innovators***. What I strive for is to achieve great in life with an aim of benefiting the society as a whole. For me analysis is very important may it be anything.Lastly my mantra, I believe everyone is born with a talent, all we need is to search the inner depths for realizing the potential.
