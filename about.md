**For life is such a dream** <br>
**Let the flight take off, enjoy the journey** <br>
**So that when you go for finishing line** <br>
**That smile you bear is the one remembered.** <br>

Interestingly, I am a geek. A coder by profession, an event manager by passion, a fun lover and a technology enthusiast who loves to explore new things. 

Well, traveling is the first thing that comes to mind when one talks about exploring. Surprisingly, I haven't much but I have cherished the beauty of Himalayas since my birth. It is this nature that drove me to ***reading and writing***, making me believe that writing is an art which I must utilise for realising my inner self and true opinions. 

There is another part of my personality that I love the most - ***My food habits. I experiment, I cook and I eat***. The satisfaction of having great food is the best joy in life.

As to what and who inspire me are ***TED talks, INK talks and innovators***. What I strive for is to achieve great in life with an aim of benefiting the society as a whole. 

Apart from this, I love the geeky me - I am glad that I got introduced to coding and now it's on my checklist of essential skills(Hopefully, someday we will talk about the checklist too!). Recently, I have realised that I really want to go ahead in the field of machine learning, ***deep learning*** to be specific. Additionally, I am also crazy about ***nanotechnology*** as the next gen tech.

In the end, I feel these lines aptly define me -  <br> <br>
**I don't wanna run,** <br>
**I wanna take a leap of faith,**  <br>
**I wanna explore the unknown,**  <br>
**And keep going on and on and on ....**  <br>
