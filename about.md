**For life is such a dream** <br>
**Let the flight take off, enjoy the journey** <br>
**So that when you go for finishing line** <br>
**That smile you bear is the one remembered.** <br>

Interestingly, I am a geek. A coder by profession, an event manager by passion, a fun lover and a technology enthusiast who loves to explore new things. 

Recently, I have realised that I really want to go ahead in the field of machine learning, ***deep learning*** to be specifc. Additionally, I am crazy about ***nanotechnology*** as the next gen tech.

But life is not only about your profession and hence I love to explore other dimensions and I end up doing varied stuff. So, I like ***traveling*** which is a lifelong dream. Well, traveling makes people think of Himalayas but guess what - I have cherished this beauty since my birth. It is this nature that drove me to ***reading and writing*** and made me believe that writing is an art which I must use for realizing my inner self and true opinions. 

There is another part of my personality that I love the most - ***My food habits. I experiment, I cook and I eat***. The satisfaction of having great food is the best joy in life.

As to what and who inspire me are ***TED talks, INK talks and innovators***. What I strive for is to achieve great in life with an aim of benefiting the society as a whole.
