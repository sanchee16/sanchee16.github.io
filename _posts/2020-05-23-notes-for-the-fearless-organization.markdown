Preface:
- Today's world is all about knowledge workers and they need to innovate continuously. 
- For this to happen, they need to be able to share concerns, questions, mistakes and even half-formed ideas.
- Psychological safety is the key to performance in today's world. Especially in the world of VUCA (Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity)
- Dynamic collaboration between teams is called Teaming. It's the art of communicating and coordinating with people across boundaries of all kinds.
- Project Aristotle by Google mentioned PS as the underpinning for all other criteria for the best performing teams. 


The Underpinning:
- Unconscious Calculators:
    - Current Risk of speaking up vs Future benefit of solving the actual problem
    - High importance to interpersonal risks
    - Worry about looking ignorant(don't ask questions), incompetent(don't accept mistakes) or disruptive(don't make suggestions)
    - 85% of respondents in a study didn't raise an issue with their boss even though they felt it as an important one
- Psychological safety an attribute of groups
    - Speaking up facilitates open and authentic communication, focus on problems rather than people who made mistakes and open opportunities for improvement
    - Microdynamics of face-saving by Goffman
- Accidental Discovery
    - Did better teams really make more mistakes? They don't make more mistakes but they declare more mistakes.
    -  Talk openly about mistakes and errors.
- Fear is not an effective motivator
    - Productivity a phenomenon of the past. Knowledge work can't be done the same way.
    - Fear inhibits learning and collaboration. 
        - It consumes physiological resources diverting them from the parts that manage working memory to the amygdala and other fear response systems to deal with the situation.
        - This blocks analytical thinking, creative insight and problem-solving. 
    - Hierarchy is also a problem. We constantly assess our relative status wrt others subconsciously. 
    - Psychological safety ensures that fear is no longer a problem. It's a safe space. One focuses more on learning.  
- What PS is not ?
    - It's not about being nice all the time. 
        - It's about candor and willingness to engage in productive disagrement so as to understand a different point of view.
    - It's not about personality types. 
        - It refers to work climate and climate affects people with different personality traits.
    - It's not same as trust
        - Trust is individual, PS is a group phenomenon. 
        - Trust is about whether you can rely on someone, PS is about temporally immediate experience.
        - Trust is about giving others a benefit of doubt, PS is about if you are given that benefit of doubt.
    - It's not about lowering performance standards
        - We still need to hold people accountable. It's just that they can except mistakes and we can work together on it. 
        - High PS, Low Standards: Comfort Zone
        - Low PS, High Standards: Anxiety Zone
        - Low PS, Low Standards: Apathy Zone
        - High PS, High Standards: Learning & Performing Zone
- Chronbach's Alpha for measuring inter-item reliability
- Psychological Safety isn't enough. We should hold high standards, inspire, coach and enable people by giving them apt and timely feedback.
