Preface:
- The pattern of certain systems is such that the forces that gives birth in the longer run act to destroy the system.
- Nature doesn't care if patterns are creative or destructive; all that matters is the way things self-organize; the way they coopoerate to form coherent patterns.
- Three sheet experiment and it's symbolism
	- First one empty
	- Second one squiggle
	- Third one dot
- Me is a passive object acted upon by others rather than I which is an active subject and takes charge. When you treat yourself as an object you define yourself by perception of others.
- Creators look at "what is" and "what can be" instead of "what is not".
- It is impossible to be creative if you are negative. 
- Our behaviour determines our attitude. We trigger the emotions we create and stregthen the attitude we wish to cultivate.
- Our decisions and our choices make our destiny.
