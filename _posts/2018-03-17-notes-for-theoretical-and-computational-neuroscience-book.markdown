Preface:

- Descriptive Models
- Mechanistic Models
- Interpretive Models

Lesson 1:

- Action potential
- Neural Encoding
- Neural Decoding
- Dendrites
- Axons
- Membrane Spanning Ion Channels
- Memberane Potential
- Na+ is much more concentrated outside a neuron than inside it
- Concentration of K+ is significantly higher inside the neuron than in the extracellular medium.
- Ions flow into and out of a cell due to both voltage and concentration gradients.
- Depolarization out of the cell and results in more negative charge membrane potential
- Hyperpolarization current flows into the cell and results in less negative or even positive charge
- If a neuron is depolarized sufficiently to raise the membrane potential above a threshold level, a positive feedback process is initiated, and the neuron generates an action potential
- An action potential is a roughly 100 mV fluctuation in the electrical potential across the cell membrane that lasts for about 1 ms
- absolute refractory period
- relative refractory period
