Week 1:

- Gyrus are the parts of the brain visible on the surface between the grooves
- The bag that keeps the chemicals together is known as the cell membrane and the chemicals themselves are all that is necessary for that cell to be alive. 
- According to estimates, humans contain 3.72 × 10^13 cells.
- Endocrine system releases harmones.
- Cell control = Endocrine + Nervous System
- Anatomical division of Nervous System
	- CNS (Central)
		- Brain
		- Spinal Cord
	- PNS (Peripheral)
- Brain 
	- Lateral Sulcus
	- Cental Sulcus
- Based on Sulcuses, we have four parts
	- Frontal Lobe
	- Temporal Lobe
	- Parietal Lobe
	- Occipital Lobe
- Two types of brain cells
	- Neurons are information processors and transmitters
	- Glia cells provide physical support for neurons and may have specific functions too. 
- Neurons
	- Usually Colourless
	- Smaller than most cells
	- Different structure than most cells
		- Dendrites
		- Axon
		- Ternimals/Synaptic ends
		- Myelin - type of glia cells which aid the process in axon  
- Types of neurons
	- Sensory
	- Motor
	- Interneurons
	- Neurons in the brain
- Maximum number of neurons as toddlers
- Limited areas have neurogenesis properties in adulthood
- Darker Areas
	- Cell bodies and dendrites
	- Gray Matter
	- Found on outer surface and center of brain
	- Folds on the cortical surface are also lined with grey matter and therefore the folds simply act to increase the surface area
- Lighter Areas
	- Axons
	- White Matter
	- Found beneath the gray matter and form bridge between two halves of brain
	- The myelin produced by the oligodendrocytes is a type of lipid (fat) and has a pale appearance so the color of white matter
- Glial Cell Type
	- Oligodendrocyte type in CNS
	- Schwann cell type in PNS
- Why the folded structure
	- As brain evolved to grow bigger and contain more cells there were two options
	- Increase surface area or folded structure
	- Rodents have smooth brains 
- Brain function is localised
- Similar looking neurons are grouped together and have same functions
- Penfield’s maps
- Homunculus is neurological map of human body for motor functions
