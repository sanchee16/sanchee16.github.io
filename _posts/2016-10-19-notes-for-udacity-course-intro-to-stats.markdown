This is the course offered by Sabestian Thrun.

Lesson 1:

- Using statistics he shows how we are actually less popular than our friends in expectation. This is actually called Friendship paradox.
- He tells how statistics plays a main role in coverting data to decisions and the fact that a good statistician spends a lot of time at looking the data.
- There is a discussion about scatter plot, linearity, outliers and noise and describes how bar charts address the issue of noise by merging points into single bar.
