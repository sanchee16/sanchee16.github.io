Lesson 1:

- Sample mean = Population Mean
- Sample Standard Deviation = Population Standard Deviation/sqrt(number of samples) = Standard Error
- z score indicates how many standard deviation is an element from the mean
- Distribution of sample means is sampling distribution
- Point Estimate 
- Mean of Treated Population vs Sample Mean 
- In a normal distribution, 68% of sample falls in one Sample SD and 95% SD fall in two Sample SD
- 2 * Sample SD is margin of error
- 95% Confidence Interval is mean +/- margin of error
- 95% of sample means are within 1.96 Standard Errors from the population mean in a sampling distribution
