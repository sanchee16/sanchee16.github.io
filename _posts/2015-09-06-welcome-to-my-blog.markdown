First of all, thanks for visiting my blog. 

I think of this blog as my scratch book. A place where I can write about my experiences in personal and professional life. Remember the days we used to write diaries in the childhood as <br>
Dear Diary, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I did ......... <br>

This blog is the same dear diary - the only difference being this diary is open to all. 

Earlier I thought that I will confine this blog to just tech related learnings and then I saw [this blog][hintjens blog] and it gave me something I can never forget. Every time he mentioned about his last days he taught something important to me. All I can feel - he is so bold and he is making me learn something through his personal experiences of last days and so, I decided to eventually write my own personal experiences and make it open to all. May be someday; someone; reading my experiences will get the strength I got due to Pieter Hintjens.

But to start, I am coming up with personal notes about a book I am currently reading these days. So, stay tuned since something interesting is coming up really soon.
