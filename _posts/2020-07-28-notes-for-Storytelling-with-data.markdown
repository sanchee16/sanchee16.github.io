Introduction:
- It’s too easy today to generate tables, charts, graphs. There were times when people did illustrations by hand, which meant you had to think before committing pen to paper.
- Having all the information in the world at our fingertips doesn’t make it easier to communicate: it makes it harder. The more information you’re dealing with, the more difficult it is to filter down to the most important bits.
- Bad graphs are everywhere
- Anyone can put some data into a graphing application and create a graph

Importance of context:
- Explorartory vs Explainatory
- To whom are we communicating ?
	- Identifying the decision maker is one way of narrowing your audience.
- What do we want the audience to know or do ?
	- Focus on discussion around action and prompt them to make a decision
	- Using Verbs for the same
- How can you use data to help make your point?
	- Amount of control vs level of detail
	- Live Presentation
		- Practice makes perfect
		- Able to respond to user cues
	- Written Doc
	- Slidement
- What tone do you want your communication to set?
- What data is available that will help make my point?
- Consulting for context
	- What background information is relevant or essential?
	- Who is the audience or decision maker? What do we know about them?
	- What biases does our audience have that might make them supportive of or resistant to our message?
	- What data is available that would strengthen our case? Is our audi- ence familiar with this data, or is it new?
	- Where are the risks: what factors could weaken our case and do we need to proactively address them?
	- What would a successful outcome look like?
	- If you only had a limited amount of time or a single sentence to tell your audience what they need to know, what would you say?
- 3 minute story and a big idea for precise communication
	- Big Idea
		- It must articulate your unique point of view
		- It must convey what’s at stake
		- It must be a complete sentence
- For planning the content use storyboarding
	- Issue
	- Pre analysis
	- Ideas for overcoming the issue
	- Post analysis
	- Recommendation


Choosing an Effective Visual:
- Simple text
	- When you have just a number or two that you want to communicate suse the numbers directly
	- If you have two numbers, you can represent the change between orginal and new value
- Tables
	- Never to use it in live presentation
	- Use light or minimal borders to make data standout
	- Interact with our verbal system
- Heatmap
	- Color saturation
- Chart vs Graph
- Graphs
	- Interact with our visual system
	- Points
		- Scatterplot
	- Lines
		- Plot continuous Data/data over time
		- Focus is on relative position in space so no need to start with 0 baseline
		- Types
			- Standard Line Graph
			- Slopegraph
				- Two points of comparison and want to quickly show relative increases and decreases or differences across various categories between the two data points.
	- Bars
		- Show categorical data
		- Start with a 0 baseline
		- If you want your audience to focus on big‐picture trends, think about preserving the axis but deemphasizing it by making it grey.
		- If the specific numerical values are important, it may be bet- ter to label the data points directly. Omit the axis to avoid the inclusion of redundant information
		- Types
			- Vertical (Single or multi series)
			- Stacked vertical bar 
				- Compare totals across categories and see the subcomponent pieces within a given category. 
			- Waterfall
				- Transitions with ins and outs
			- Horizontal bar
				- Logical ordering of categories. Show most important category at top and rest in decrasing order or vice versa
			- Stacked horizontal bar
				- Likert scale 
				- Subcomponent pieces can be structured to show either absolute values or sum to 100%. Showing sum as 100% usually works better
	- Area
		- Not too great for human eyes
		- Except for when to visualize numbers greatly vast magnitude
		- Types
			- Square Area Graphs
- Infographic
- What to avoid ?
	- Pie Charts
		- Replace with horizontal chart
	- Donut Charts
	- 3D Charts
	- Secondary y-axis
		- Instead,label the data points that belong on y-axis directly with focus on the data points
		- Pull the graphs apart vertically and have separate y‐axis for each (both along the left) but leverage the same x‐axis across both with focus on the trend than the numbers
		- Link the axis to the data to be read against it through the use of color
- What is the right graph for my situation? Whatever will be easiest for your audience to read.


Clutter is your enemy:
- Identify everything that isn't adding informative value
- Cognitive load
	- As designers of information, we want to be smart about how we use our audience’s brain power.
