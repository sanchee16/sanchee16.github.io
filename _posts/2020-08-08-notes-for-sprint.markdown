Preface:
- It all started when Jake wanted to make his days more productive and meaningful
- Further trigger came when someone asked Jake - "How do you know brainstorming works?"
- His experience with Priority Inbox and Google Hangouts Projects
- He retrospected on how were these two projects different than brainstorming
	- Sufficient time but not too much time
	- Focus on individual work
	- Time to prototype
	- Inescapable deadline
- Jake joining Google Ventures
	- Barden Kowitz added story-centered design
	- John Zeratsky helped bring in the idea of starting at the end
	- Michael Margolis helped in figuring out how to bring results in one day 
- Sprint is a way to get more done faster be it solving big probems or testing out new ideas

Introduction:
- Savioke Labs & Willow Garage 
- Monday is all about the problem. Pick up a problem and the important area to focus.
	- Have a question that you are trying to answer ?
	- Create a map to identify big risks; thinking of map like a story
	- Ask questions that worry you
- Tuesday move from problem to solutions
	- Let people sketch their solutions
- Wednesday finalize on the solution and turn ideas into testable hypothesis
- Thursday build the prototype; Voting and structured discussion
- Friday present to the customer
	- Build up for the interview and keep things as surprise for the end user if possible
- Good ideas are hard to find. Execution is even more difficult.
- Payoff of a success as a part of sprint is amazing but any failures mean quick learnings and high ROI
- Sprint is a practical way to deploy lean philosophy and design thinking
- Also, complimentary to agile

Set the stage:
- Right challenge with the right team with time and space to conduct it
- Challenge
	- Blue Bottle Story
	- The bigger the challenge the better the sprint
	- When to organize for a sprint:
		- High Stakes
		- Not Enough Time
		- Just plain stuck
	- Graco Story
	- No problem is too large for sprint
		- Focus on pressing questions
		- Learn from the surface of finished products
- Team
	- Sprint resembles perfectly orchesterated heist
	- The Decider is the ofiicial decision maker of the project
		- He brings core values & vision
		- Rapid Progress
		- Experiment
		- Explain the tradeoffs
		- Focus
	- 7 people or fewer
	- Mix of experts and executioners
		- Decider
		- Finance Expert
		- Marketing Expert
		- Marketing Expert
		- Customer Expert
		- Tech/Logistics Expert
		- Design Expert
		- Troublemaker - Rebel vs Jerk
		- Facilitator
	- Deep expertise and excitement about the challenge
	- Schedule extra experts on Monday
- Time and Space
	- Fragmentation hurts productivity
	- 10-5 
	- Ensure high energy level throughout the week
	- Weekends cause a loss of continuity
	- Breaks as pressure release valves
	- No device rule. Exceptions being
		- Check the device during the break
		- Okay to leave the room to check the device
	- Whiteboards make us smarter
		- Check the whiteboard before the sprint starts
		- Short term memory of humans isn't that great as the spatial memory is. 
		- The simulatneous visbility of these project materials helps us identify patterns and encourages creative synthesis to occur much more readily than when these resources are hidden away in file folders, notebooks, PowerPoint Decks. - Tim Brown
		- 2 whiteboards
			- Rolling Whiteboards
			- IdeaPaint
			- Paper
	- Stock up the supplies
	- FN
		- Magic Clock
			- Time Timer

Monday:
- Start at the End
	- Apollo 13 story
		- Clear goal and a simple diagram keep the team focussed on the right problems
		- Organized and sorted priorities before starting on solutions
	- Start at the End
		- Look ahead to end of the sprint
		- <strong><em>Set a long term goal</em></strong>
			- Why are we doing this project ?
			- In 6 months time, what would have improved in business?
			- Slow down and clarify if required but spend time on this
			- What makes the goal challenging and ambitious ?
			- Goal should reflect team principles and aspirations
		- <strong><em>Sprint Questions</em></strong>
			- The questions that must be answered this week
			- What will have to be true for us to meet the long term goal ?
			- Is it scalable ?
			- Imagine a bleaky future to examine the assumptions 
				- What caused it to fail ?
				- How did the goal go wrong ?
			- Rephrase Assumptions and Obstacles into questions
				- Creates a subtle shift from uncertainity which is uncomfortable to curiosity which is exciting
- Map
	- Shows user moving through your service or product
	- Helps to narrow broad challenge into a specific target
	- Structure for solution sketches and prototype
	- They have to be <strong>simple</strong>
	- Maps are customer centric and have a story; a beginning, middle and an end
	- Maps have key actors on the left; final action.ending on the right and all the steps in between these two extremes
	- 5-15 steps at max
	- Ask for help

- Ask the Experts
	- Nobody knows everything
		- Strategy
			- Start by talking to Decider
				- What will make this project a success ?
				- What's our unique advantage or oppotunity ?
				- What's the biggest risk ?
		- Voice of customer
		- How things work ? Who understands the product the best ?
		- Previous Efforts
	- Early input in the process makes people more invested in the outcome. They become the supporters
	- Steps
		- Introduce the sprint
		- Review the whiteboards - goal, sprint questions and map
		- Ask them to tell you what they about the challenge
		- Ask Questions
			- Act like a bunch of reporters digging for a story
			- Ask them whar can go wrong
		- Fix the whiteboards
		- If they truly are experts; they will tell you what you don't even know how to ask
	- How Might We
		- Open minded and optimistic phrasing to look out for opportunities and challenges
		- Don't get bogged down by the problems
		- Remind us ... is a useful question
		- Neither to broad nor too narrow questions
		- Organise how might we into groups
			- Misfit notes labelled as Misc
		- Put the highest voted notes on the map
- Target 
	- By looking at goal, map and the how might we notes, the target mostly pops right out
	- Place on the map where you have the biggest opportunity to do something great
	- Pick one target customer and one target event
	- Straw Poll
	- See which sprint question lines up with the target
	- FN
		- Ask for Permission
			- For keeping track of time
		- Always be capturing
			- Does it look right ?
			- How do we capture that ?
			- Is there a good way to capture this thinking and move on ?
		- Ask obvious questions
			- Dumb questions are genuine for outsiders
		- Take care of humans
			- Take frequent breaks
			- Lunch late at 1 pm
			- Eat light and often
		- Decide and move on 

Tuesday:
- Remix and Improve
	- Coffee, Blotting Paper and Melitta Bentz
	- Great innovation is built on existing ideas, repurposed with vision
	- Remix and Improve but never blindly copy
	- Lightening demos
		- 3 minute tours
		- Other products, different domains, within own company (inprogress but unfinished ideas or old abandoned ideas)
		- Tcho - chocholate-bar wrapper & My neightbour Totoro
		- How Lightening Demos work ?
			-  Make a list
				- Which other fields to draw inspiration from ?
			- Three minute demos to talk about what's so cool about it
			- Capture big ideas on the go
				- What's the big idea here that might be useful
			- Don't make decisions and debate while demo happens
	- Divide or swarm
		- Should you split the team into groups to tackle different parts of the problem or should you all focus on the same spot ?
- Sketch
