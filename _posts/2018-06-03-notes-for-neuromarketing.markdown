Week 1:

- Neuromarketing vs Consumer Neuroscience
    - Commercial vs Academic
    - Multidisciplinary ie Economics, Psychology and Neuroscience
- Neuroscience vs Neurology
- Cognitive or Affective Neuroscience
- Traditional Market Research is conscious behaviour
- Unconscious behaviour can be measured using Neuromarketing & Consumer Neuroscience
- Stages 
    - Representation and Attention
    - Predicted Value
    - Experienced Value
    - Remembered Value
    - Learning of brand associations
    - Brand Memory
- Brain Areas
    - Gyrus, Sulcii and Fissures
    - Cerebellum engaged in motor control, emotional responses and cognitive functions
    - Lobes
        - Occipital lobe engaged in visual input
        - Temporal lobe engaged in object recognition, object and episodic memory and hearing and language
        - Parietal lobe engaged in self awareness, spatial movement and dorsal stream function 
        - Frontal lobe engaged in working memory, preferences, decision making, motor behaviour
    - Dorsoletral Prefrontal Cortex is involved in working memory
    - Anterior Singular Cortex
    - Medial and Lateral Orbitofrontal Cortex
    - Pons
    - Mid Brain
    - Basal Ganglia
    - Thalamus
    - Olfactory Bulb
    - Insula
    - Hippocampus
    - Amygdala
- How we make choices ?
    - Showing product made activations in nucleus aaccumbens/ventral striatum part of basal ganglia
    - Showing price made activations in insula an emotional area in brain. Stronger the activate the less the chance of purchase
    - At the time of making choice, activations happened in medial prefrontal cortex
- Conscious Gambling vs Unconscious Learning
    - Nucleus Accumbens was engaged here
- fMRI
    - BOLD Signal ie Blood Oxygen-Level Dependent Signal
    - Haemodynamic Response
    - Regional Initial Dip then overshoot then undershoot and then stabalization
    - Indirect measure of brain activation
    - Resting State task
- PET Scan
    - Dopamine, Seratonine and Glucose act in presence of radioactive ligand
