Week 1:

- Neuromarketing vs Consumer Neuroscience
    - Commercial vs Academic
    - Multidisciplinary ie Economics, Psychology and Neuroscience
- Neuroscience vs Neurology
- Cognitive(Mental) or Affective(Emotional) Neuroscience
- Traditional Market Research is conscious behaviour
- Unconscious behaviour can be measured using Neuromarketing & Consumer Neuroscience
- Stages 
    - Representation and Attention
    - Predicted Value
    - Experienced Value
    - Remembered Value
    - Learning of brand associations
    - Brand Memory
- Brain Areas
    - Gyrus, Sulcii and Fissures
    - Cerebellum engaged in motor control, emotional responses and cognitive functions
    - Lobes
        - Occipital lobe engaged in visual input
        - Temporal lobe engaged in object recognition, object and episodic memory and hearing and language
        - Parietal lobe engaged in self awareness, spatial movement and dorsal stream function 
        - Frontal lobe engaged in working memory, preferences, decision making, motor behaviour
    - Dorsoletral Prefrontal Cortex is involved in working memory
    - Anterior Singular Cortex
    - Medial and Lateral Orbitofrontal Cortex
    - Pons
    - Mid Brain
    - Basal Ganglia
    - Thalamus
    - Olfactory Bulb
    - Insula
    - Hippocampus
    - Amygdala
- How we make choices ?
    - Showing product made activations in nucleus aaccumbens/ventral striatum part of basal ganglia
    - Showing price made activations in insula an emotional area in brain. Stronger the activate the less the chance of purchase
    - At the time of making choice, activations happened in medial prefrontal cortex
- Conscious Gambling vs Unconscious Learning
    - Nucleus Accumbens was engaged here
- fMRI
    - BOLD Signal ie Blood Oxygen-Level Dependent Signal
    - Haemodynamic Response
    - Regional Initial Dip then overshoot then undershoot and then stabalization
    - Indirect measure of brain activation
    - Resting State task
- PET Scan
    - Dopamine, Seratonine and Glucose act in presence of radioactive ligand


Week 2:

- Consumer choices driven by two main processes
    - Unconscious quick and dirty valuation of immediate options
    - Conscious experience of making a choice
- Conscious Perception and Experience
- Episodic Memory - memory for conscious events
- Sublimial Learning
- Unconscious Vestibular Signals
- Binocular Rivalry
- Inattention Blindness
- Global Workspace Theory
- Conscious vs Unconscious Events
- Contexts and Goal Contexts
- Waking consciousness is apparently needed for forward
spread of sensory activation to occur
- Neural Dawinist Models
- Selective Attention
- Unconscious Egocentric and Allocentric Cellular Maps
- Contralateral neglect
- Parietal cortex is involved in the first-person perspective

- Attention and Consciousness
    - Automatic attention
    - Controlled attention
    - Conscious Experience
    - Selection process
    - Attention is limited
    - Bottom up vs top down attention
    - Bottom up
        - Automatically grab attention (contrast, density, movement, brightness, color, shape)
        - Thalamus receives the signal projects to primary visual cortex
        - Bottom up attention also called visual saliency
        - Neurovision
    - Top down
        - Prefrontal and parietal part are involved
        - Intentional Attention which is cognitively driven
    - Consciousness is a state or an experience
        - Purpose, challenging situations
    - Unconscious during deep sleep
        - Autopilot mode
    - Brain consumes almost 20% of body energy
    - Brands can imbue value unconsciously and drive attention
    - Much of actions taken as a consumer is unconscious

- Behaviour economics
- Incorrect assumptions with Intercept
    - Asking the correct questions
    - Customer purchase was based on a conscious decision
    - Customer's capability to justify their purchase
- Neurovision
    - Visual Saliency meaning a heat map which is not so scattered
    - Fog map reverse of heat map
- Consciousness is expensive in terms of energy needs amd autopilot behaviour makes sense
- Under stress or when we have less time to make decision, visual saliency has a lot to say about


Week 3:

- Five Sections of Brain
    - Occipital: Visual processing
    - Parietal: Attention, Self Awareness
    - Temporal: Language, Memory and Visual Perception
    - Frontal: Motor Control, Planning, Preference and Working Memory
    - Insular: Emotions
- Other important brain structures
    - Basal Ganglia: Putanum, Caudate Nucleus, Ventral Stratum
    - Medial Temporal Lobe Structures - Hippocampus, Parietal Cortex, Amygdala
    - Cingulate Cortex: Anterior and Posterior
- Concepts of how brain works
    - Redundancy: Function performed by two or more identical regions
    - Degeneracy: Function performed by two or more dissimilar regions
    - Pluripotentiality: One structure can take on many roles
- Blind spot experiment
- Brain fills in meaning even when there is an incomplete visual scene
- Dorsal and ventral stream of brain
    - Ventral stream from primary visual cortex to temporal cortex contain info about identity of objects
    - Dorsal stream is all about navigation
- Branding
    - Odour
    - Touch
    - Sound
- Sensory Neuromarketing
    - Sensory Load chart
    - Effect of scents on brand memory or brand recall
- Sensory Load Chart
- iMotions
    - Eye tracking
    - Pupiliometry
    - Distance to screens
    - Blinks
    - Attentional Blink
    - EEG
    - Galvanic Skin Response
    - EMT
    - Muscle Contractions
    - Heart Rate
