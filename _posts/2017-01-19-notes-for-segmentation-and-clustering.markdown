Lesson 1:

- Segmentation 
- Standardization where we treat a group as a whole
- Localization where we treat them as individuals
- Grouping or binning
- It becomes difficult to group as the number of variables increase
- Clustering is a mathematical procedure for multidimensional analysis
- For a given set of objects, this procedure groups similar objects into clusters 
- Distance is way to measure similarity
- Intra cluster separation is minimized and inter cluster distance is maximized
- eg. Fradulant insurance Claim, User Segmentation, Bioinformatics Study, Education
- Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
