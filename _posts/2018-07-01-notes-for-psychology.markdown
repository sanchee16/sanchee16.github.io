Video 11:

- Ivan Pavlov introduced behaviourism as a field psychology
	- Science focused on observable behaviours and not unobservable internal mental processes
	- Dog salivation experiment
- Learning is the process of acquiring new and enduring information or behaviours through experience
- Associative Learning happens when a subject links certain events, behaviour and stimuli together in process of conditioning
- Acquisition and After conditioning phase
- Classic Conditioning is the type of learning where subject learns to link two or more stimuli and anticipate events
- Learning can be studied through direct observation of behaviour
	- Psychology about objective observable behaviour
- Operant Conditioning is a type of learning where behaviour is strengthened if followed by reinforcer or diminished if followed by punisher
	- Shaping is an Operant Conditioning procedure in which reinforcers guide behaviour towards closer and closer approximations of the desired behavior
		- Sucessive approximations
	- Skinner box
	- Air Crib
	- Positive Reinforcement is a stimulus which when present after a response strengthens it
	- Negative Reinforcement is a stimulus which when removed after a response strengthens it
		- Negative Reinforcement is not punishment
	- Primary Reinforcers is an innately biologically reinforcing stimulus
	- Conditioned Reinforcers is a stimulus that gains it's reinforcing power from association with primary reinforcer
	- Reinforcement schedules is a pattern that defines how often does a desired response will be reinforced
	- Partial or intermittent reinforcement is a way in which we reinforce the behaviour only part of the time resulting in slower acquisition of response but much greater resistance to extinction than does continuous reinforcement
	- Extinction
- Cognitive processes also influence the way we learn


Video 12:

- Albert Bandura
	- Bobo Beatdown
	- Learning can occur through observing and immitating someone else's behaviour
	- Imitation is sincerest form of learning
	- Observational Learning is learning by observing others
	- Modelling is process of observing and imitating a specific behaviour 
	- Socio-Cognitive Learning
- Humans are more taste averse than sound/sight averse
- Birds are more sight averse
- Not all associations are learnt equally
	- Depends on species too as associations which help them survive and thrive are learnt with priority
	- What we learn shapes our attitudes
- Cognitions
	- Thoughts, perspectives and expectations

Video 13:

- HerpesViral Encephalitis wrecks the memory
- Memory is the chain that connects past to present
- Personal Memories are stored differently
- Memory is learning persisted over time ie information that has been stored and can be recalled
- Memories accessed in 3 ways:
	- Recall is the measure of memory in which you access the already learned information
	- Recognition is the measure of memory in which you identify items previously learned
	- Relearning is the measure of memory in which you refreshing old information
- Memory formation
	- External Events lead to sensory memory
	- Encoding to short term memory for under 30 seconds
	- Encoding to long term memory and further retrieval
- Working memory
	- Conscious, active processing of auditory and visual-spatial information and info reterieved from long term memory
	- Explicit Memory is the memory of facts and experiences one can consciously know and declare
	- Implicit Memory is the retention of memory independent of conscious recollection
	- Automatic processing
		- Non-conscious encoding of incidental and well learned information
- Long term Memory
	- Procedural Memory
	- Episodic Memory
- Mnemonics helps in memory aids especially those techniques that use vivid imagery and organisational devices
	- Chunking is organising items into familiar managable units
	- Shallow processing is encoding information based on auditory or visual levels eg. based on structure, appearance or sound of word
	- Deep processing is encoding information based on the meaning associated with a word

- Serial Positioning Effect
	- Our tendency to best recall first and last items in a list
	- Primacy Effect for first words which we rehearsed them more and were in long term memory
	- Recency Effect for last words which remain in working memory
- We forget things in 3 ways:
	- We fail to encode it
	- We fail to retrieve it
		- Can happen because of interference of other memories in brain
	- We experience storage decay
- Proactive/Forward Acting Interference
	- The disruptive effect of prior learning on the recall of new information
- Retroactive/Backward Acting Interference
	- The disruptive effect of new learning on the recall of previous information
