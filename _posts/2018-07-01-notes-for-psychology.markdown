Video 1:

- Psychology comes from latin meaning study of soul
- The science of behavior and mental processes
- Various schools of thought
	- Structuralism
		- Wilhelm Wundt
	- Functionalism
		- William James
		- Inspired by Charles Darwin
		- Adaptive behaviours are conserved throughout the evolution
		- Defined psychology as science of mental life
	- Psychoanalysis
		- Sigmond Freud
		- Free Associate Technique
		- Unconscious Motives
		- Mental Disorders to be healed through talk therapy and self discovery
		- Later descended to psycholdynamic theory
	- Behaviourism
		- B.F. Skinner


Video 2:

- False Intution
- Hindsight Bias (I knew it all along phenomenon)
- Operationalizing the question
- Research Methods
	- Scientific method
		- Question and build a theory
		- Make hypothesis and test your prediction
		- Test with a replicable experiment
	- Case studies can overgeneralizing
	- Naturalistic observation
		- Good at describing behaviour
		- Limited in explaining it
	- Surveys and interviews
	- Experiments 
- Sampling Bias
- How behaviours corelate
- But corelation is not causation and hence cannot prove anything
- Experiments studying only one variable keeping others constant
- Experimental and control group
- Placebo an inert substance
- Double blind procedure


Video 3:

- Everything psychological is biological
- Neuron's electrochemical nature
	- Bipolar/Interneuron
	- Unipolar/Sensory
	- Multipolar/Motor
	- Pyramidal 
- Soma, Dendrites, Axon, Synapses and Myelin Sheath
- Multiple Sclerosis caused by damage to myelin sheath leading to lack of muscle control
- Neurotransmitters
	- Excitatory
		- Norphinephrine
		- Glutamate
	- Inhibitory
		- GABA (Gamma Aminobutyric Axid)
		- Seretonin
	- Endorphins (Pain control and pleasure)
	- Acetylchlonin and Dopamine can behave as both
	- Alzheimer's patients experience deterioration of Acetylchlonin producing neurons
	- Schizophrenia
- Endocrine System
	- Hormones
	- Attraction, Appetite and Aggression
	- Take more time than neurotransmitters for reaction
	- Adrenal Glands, Pencreas, Thyroid, Parathyroids, Ovaries, Pitutary Gland, Hypothalamus 
- Reuptake is a process of absorption of excess of neurotransmitter by the neuron that released them


Video 4:

- Phrenology is the study of shape and size of cranium
- Different parts of brain control specific behaviour
- Function is localised
- Brain and mind(memories, consciousness, behaviour, decisions)
- How brain functions tie to the behaviour of mind
- CNS
- PNS
- Case of Phineas Gage
- Old Brain 
	- Brain Stem
	- Medulla
	- Pons
	- Thalamus
	- Reticular Formation
	- Cerebellum
- Limbic System
	- Hypothalamus
	- Amygdala
	- Hippocampus
- Grey Matter in cerebrum
	- Corpus Collosum
- Glial Cells
- Lobes
	- Frontal
	- Parietal
	- Occipital
	- Temporal
- Fissures
- Cortex
	- Cerebral cortex
	- Motor Cortex
	- Somatosensory Cortex
- Association Areas


Video 5:

- Prosopagnosia neurological disorder of face blindness
- Fusiform Gyrus
- Sensation vs Perception
	- Bottom up process in which sensory organs receive and relay outside stimuli
	- Top down way in which brain organizes and interpret information to put it into context 
- Absolute threshold of sensation is the minimum stimulation needed to register a given stimulus 50% of the time.
- Signal Detection Theory is a model for predicting how and when a person will detect a weak stimuli partly based on context
- Sensory Adaptation
- Difference Threshold
	- Weber's Law is that we percieve differences on log scale and not linear scale
- Wavelength and frequency determine hue
- Amplitude determine intensity or brightness
- Photoreceptors
	- Rods(Grayscale and Peripheral Vision) and Cones(Fine detail and color)
- Theories of color vision
	- Young Helmholtz Trichromatic Theory
		- Dichromatic vs Trichromatic Vision
	- Opponent Process Theory
- Feature Detector nerve cells
- Parallel Processing of Form, Motion, Depth and Color


Video 6:

- Homunculus(little man) is sensory map of human body
- Short Waves have high frequency and high pitch
- Amplitude determines loudness measured in Decibels
- Directional Stereophonic Hearing
- Ear Structure
	- Outer Ear
	- Middle Ear
	- Inner Ear
	- Ear Drum
	- Ossicle Bones
		- Stirrup
		- Anvil
		- Hammer
	- Cochlea
	- Auditory Nerve
- Taste Buds
	- Taste Pore
	- Supporting Cell
	- Gustatory Receptor Cell
- Umami Taste
- Sensory Interaction
- Synesthesia is sensory activation of one sense when another sense is triggered.
- Smell is Chemical Sense
	- Olfactory Receptors
	- Olfactory Bulb
	- Primary Smell Cortex
	- Odor Receptors
	- Near our lymbic system - amygdala and hippocampus and hence related to emotional response
- Touching
	- Pressure
	- Warmth
	- Cold
	- Pain
- Kinesthesis is the way in which body senses it's own movements and positioning
- Vestibular Sense monitors head's position and balance
	- Semicircular canals
	- Vestibular Sac
	- Cochlea


Video 7:

- Perception is the top-down way in which brain organises and interpret information and put it into context
	- Make meaning out of our senses
- Duck vs Bunny
- Perceptual Set is the list of psychological factors that determine how we percieve the enviroment
	- Context
	- Culture
	- Expectation
- Form Perception
	- Figure Ground Relationship
		- Organisation of visual field into objects that stand out from their surroundings
	- Rules of grouping
		- Orgainizing things by proximity
		- Continuity
		- Closure
- Depth Perception
	- Ability to see objects in 3D even when the retinal images are 2D
	- Estimate distance and shape
	- Binocular Cues and Retinal Disparity
	- Monocular Cues 
		- Relative size and height
		- Linear Perspective
		- Texture Gradient
		- Interposition
- Motion Perception
	- Shrinking objects are retreating 
	- Enlarging objects are approaching
- Constancy
	- Ability to percieve objects even when stimulus changes slightly
