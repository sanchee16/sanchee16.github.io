Lesson 1:

- Programming Paradigms
    - Imperative
    - Functional 
    - Logic
- Object Oriented (Orthogonal to above three)
- Imperative Programming
    - Modifying mutable variables 
    - Using assignments
    - Control Structures
- Theory 
    - One or more data types
    - Operation on these data types
    - Laws that describe the relationships between values and operations
    - Doesn't describe the mutations
    - Polynomial and Strings
    - Consequences 
        - No place for mutation 
        - Mutation can destroy other useful laws
        - Define theories for operators defined as functions 
        - Powerful ways to abstract and compose functions
