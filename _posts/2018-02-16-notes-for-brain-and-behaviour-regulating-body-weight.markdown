Week 1:

- Energy in = Energy out
- Energy out
	- Physical Exercise
	- Basal Matabolic Rate
	- Diet-Induced Thermogenesis
- 5 meals a day
- Food triggers
	- People with you 
	- Visual Cues
	- Time of the day
	- Comfort foods
	- Learned Cues
- Homestasis refers to biological processes that keep certain body variables within a fixed range.
	- System variable is the variable that is controlled by a regulatory mechanism.
	- Set point is the optimal value of the system variable in the regulatory system.
	- Detector monitors the value of the system variable.
	- Correctional mechanism is required to restore the system to the set point.
	- Negative feedback is a process to diminish or terminate the action set in place to return the system variable to set point once set point is achieved. This is essential to regulatory systems.
	- Satiety mechanisms are produced by adequate and available supplies of the variable in question.
- Pavlov Dog Saliva Study
- Classical or Pavlovian Conditioning
- Unconditioned and Conditioned Response and Stimulus
- Insulin increases in anticipation of food called cephalic phase insulin release


Week 2:


- Signals 
	- Short Term signals tell about a meal
	- Long Term (Adiposity) arise from adipose/fat(leptin) tissue and pancreas(insulin)
	- CNS
- Blood Brain Barrier is the highly selective semi permeable membrane that protects the brain
	- Passive diffusion in fat soluble harmones, water
	- Active transport for leptin
	- Neural Transmission via vegus nerve(cranial nerve)
- Orexigenic Appetite Stimulant and antonym anorexia is an eating disorder
- Obesity depends on 
	- How big is a meal
	- How much time between meals
	- How much time is spent eating a meal
- Roles of insulin
	- Involved in Short and Long term control of food intake and body weight regulation
	- Used in creating drugs for type 2 diabetes 
- Hormones
	- Gut Hormones
		- Ghrelin 
			- Increases food intake
			- Meal initiating hormone
			- Peripheral Hormone made in stomach
			- Acts at receptors in hypothalamus
			- Stimulates neurogenic peptides
			- Released in anticipation of eating food
		- Cholecystokinin (CCK)
			- Released in intestinal tract and found in gut and brain
			- Tells body and brain when and what food is ingested
			- Reduces food intake
			- Found in duodenum and jejunum ie upper and middle small intestine
			- Trianguar shaped and apical side is towards the inside of intestine
			- Basal Plasma CCK levels increase with a meal 
			- Dietary Fat and protein are more potent stimulators of CCK than carbohydrates
			- Obesity not treated using this as it reduces the meal size but increases the frequency of the meals in a day
		- Glucagon-like Peptide 1
			- Produced in intestinal tract ie ileum and closer to the stomach
			- Also produced in hindbrain (Nucleus of solitary tract)
			- Stops food intake
			- During fast period, concentrations of GLP-1 are low
			- Incretin hormone amplify insulin secretion
			- Used to model drugs for diabetes
