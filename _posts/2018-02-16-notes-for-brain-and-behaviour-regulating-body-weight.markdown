- Homestasis refers to biological processes that keep certain body variables within a fixed range.
	- System variable is the variable that is controlled by a regulatory mechanism.
	- Set point is the optimal value of the system variable in the regulatory system.
	- Detector monitors the value of the system variable.
	- Correctional mechanism is required to restore the system to the set point.
	- Negative feedback is a process to diminish or terminate the action set in place to return the system variable to set point once set point is achieved. This is essential to regulatory systems.
	- Satiety mechanisms are produced by adequate and available supplies of the variable in question.
