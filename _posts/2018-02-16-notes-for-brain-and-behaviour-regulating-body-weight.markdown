Week 1:

- Energy in = Energy out
- Energy out
	- Physical Exercise
	- Basal Matabolic Rate
	- Diet-Induced Thermogenesis
- 5 meals a day
- Food triggers
	- People with you 
	- Visual Cues
	- Time of the day
	- Comfort foods
	- Learned Cues
- Homestasis refers to biological processes that keep certain body variables within a fixed range.
	- System variable is the variable that is controlled by a regulatory mechanism.
	- Set point is the optimal value of the system variable in the regulatory system.
	- Detector monitors the value of the system variable.
	- Correctional mechanism is required to restore the system to the set point.
	- Negative feedback is a process to diminish or terminate the action set in place to return the system variable to set point once set point is achieved. This is essential to regulatory systems.
	- Satiety mechanisms are produced by adequate and available supplies of the variable in question.
- Pavlov Dog Saliva Study
- Classical or Pavlovian Conditioning
- Unconditioned and Conditioned Response and Stimulus
- Insulin increases in anticipation of food called cephalic phase insulin release


Week 2:


- Signals 
	- Short Term signals tell about a meal
	- Long Term (Adiposity) arise from adipose/fat(leptin) tissue and pancreas(insulin)
	- CNS
- Blood Brain Barrier is the highly selective semi permeable membrane that protects the brain
	- Passive diffusion in fat soluble harmones, water
	- Active transport for leptin
	- Neural Transmission via vegus nerve(cranial nerve)
- Orexigenic Appetite Stimulant and antonym anorexia is an eating disorder
- Obesity depends on 
	- How big is a meal
	- How much time between meals
	- How much time is spent eating a meal
- Roles of insulin
	- Involved in Short and Long term control of food intake and body weight regulation
	- Used in creating drugs for type 2 diabetes 
- Hormones
	- Gut Hormones
		- Ghrelin 
			- Increases food intake
			- Meal initiating hormone
			- Peripheral Hormone made in stomach
			- Acts at receptors in hypothalamus
			- Stimulates neurogenic peptides
			- Released in anticipation of eating food
		- Cholecystokinin (CCK)
			- Released in intestinal tract and found in gut and brain
			- Tells body and brain when and what food is ingested
			- Reduces food intake
			- Found in duodenum and jejunum ie upper and middle small intestine
			- Trianguar shaped and apical side is towards the inside of intestine
			- Basal Plasma CCK levels increase with a meal 
			- Dietary Fat and protein are more potent stimulators of CCK than carbohydrates
			- Obesity not treated using this as it reduces the meal size but increases the frequency of the meals in a day
		- Glucagon-like Peptide 1
			- Produced in intestinal tract ie ileum and closer to the stomach
			- Also produced in hindbrain (Nucleus of solitary tract)
			- Stops food intake
			- During fast period, concentrations of GLP-1 are low
			- Incretin hormone amplify insulin secretion
			- Used to model drugs for diabetes
	- Pancreatic Hormones
		- PYY3 - 36
			- Released from intestines esp from ileum and colon
		- Pencreatic Polypeptide
			- Produced by cells in pencreas
			- Released in circulation system after food is processed
			- Released both in cephalic phase(anticipation of food) and gastric phase(food is in gut)
		- Insulin
			- Directly proportional to fat mass
			- Cephalic phase release
			- Handles glucose in negative direction
			- Act as receptor in brain including hypothalamus
			- Reduces food intake
- Stomach releases hormones that trigger hunger signals
- Intestinal tract releases hormones when we eat
- Hormones stimulate or inhibit parts of your brain to affect feeding
- Environmental and learned factors can change response to signals generated by the gut and brain to change behaviors.
- Gut
	- Stomach
	- Small intestine
		- Duodenum
		- Jejunum
		- Ileum
	- Large intestine
	- Liver
	- Pencreas
- Adiposity Signals
	- Hormones that provide information to brain about overall energy status
	- Released in proportion to fat mass
	- If Lacking then hyperphagic and obese, if excess then hypophagic and loose weight
	- Accesses and acts at the areas of brain which are involved in controlling food intake and regulating energy balance
- Adiposity Hormones
	- Leptin
	- Insulin
- Hypothalamus
	- Communicates with pitutary gland via secretion of hormones
	- Lateral Hypothalamus
		- Lesions to this area cause Aneroxic and stimulation causes hyperphagia
		- Was thought of as Hunger Center
		- Neural connections to hindbrain
			- Nucleus of the solitary tract
				- Taste processing
		- Neural connections to cerebral cortex
			- Facilitate ingestion
			- Increase cortical responses to taste, smell or sight of food
	- Ventromedial Hypothalamus
		- Lesions to this area cause hyperphagia and stimulation causes Aneroxic
		- Was thought of as Satiety Center
		- Lesions result in increased meal frequency and faster gastric emptying
			- Damage increases insulin production increasing food storage
	- Hormones from gut signal hypothalamus about energy status
		- Arculate Nucleus has two types of neurons
			- Orexigenic neuropeptides
				- Neuropeptide Y
				- Agouti related protein
				- Stimulation of these neurons stimulates food intake
				- Grehlin stimulates NPY and AgRP
			- Anorexigenic neuropeptides
				- Pro-opiomelanocortin
				- Cocaine Amphetamine Regulated Transcript
				- Stimulation of these neurons decreases food intake
				- Insulin and Leptin stimulates POMC and CART
- Associated brain areas involved in regulating energy balance
	- Learning and Memory
		- Hippocampus
	- Reward system
		- Neurotransmitter Dopamine
			- Active in Nucleus Accumbens and Ventral Tegmental
		- Neuronal projections from the hypothalamus
	- Taste
		- Nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) in hindbrain
		- Receives input from taste buds and several cranial nerves
			- Facial, Vagus, and Glossopharyngeal cranial nerves
		- Flavor is the result of integration of taste and smell properties
		- Parabrachial nuclei (PbN) of the pons and Medullary motor nuclei in brain determine the quality and concentration of tastes
- Maintaining Weight Loss
	- With weight loss we have decreased leptin and we have increased activity in brain areas associated with emotional, cognitive and sensory control of food intake
	- Leptin treatment post weight loss is beneficial
- Sweet treats after meals for several biological, psychological and lifestyle-related reasons
	- Low serotonin levels cause us to want to eat sugar
	- Serotonin is a chemical in the brain that elevates mood
	- Sugar can help the body absorb tryptophan, which helps produce serotonin
