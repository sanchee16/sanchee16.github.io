Lesson 1 (Numerical Methods: Modeling and Error):

- Numerical Methods vs Analytical Methods
	- Approximate vs Exact
- The process of going from Real world problem to Mathematical Model is Mathematical
 Modeling. Need to make approx. and assumptions
- Trade offs in Mathematical Modeling
	- Solution Accuracy vs Model Complexity 
	- User Friendliness vs Programming Effort
	- Timeliness vs Software Availability Commercial vs Custom Software 
	- Generality (Breadth of Application) vs Modeling Expertise & Method Availability
- Practical Solution - The one in which benefits overweight costs
- Error Analysis 
	- Sources of error
		- Modeling Error 
			- Human Mistakes
			- Formulation Error
			- Data Uncertainity
		- Numerical Error
			- Truncation Error
			- Round off Error
				- Quantization Error
				- Numerical Manipulations
- Accuracy vs Precision 
	- Accuracy is how correct we are wrt the target
	- Precision is how close we are to the target
	- Accuracy describes the difference between the measurement and the part's actual value
	- Precision describes the variation you see when you measure the same part repeatedly 
 with the same device.
