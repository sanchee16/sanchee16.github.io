Week 1:

- Sensory input -> integration -> motor output
- CNS And PNS
- PNS
    - Sensory or affrent division picks up stimuli
    - Motor or effernt division responds to stimuli
        - Somatic nervous system (Voluntary) rules skeletal muscle movement
        - Autonomic nervous system (Involuntary) rules heart beat, breath and stomach chruning
            - Sympathetic Division fires up the body
            - Parasympathetic Division relaxes the body
- Neurons
- Glial Cells
    - CNS
        - Astrocytes surround, support and regulate ions
        - Microglial Cells defend the neurons and perform immune operations
        - Ependymal Cells line cavities and create, secrete and circulate cerebrospiral fluid
        - Oligodendrocytes wrap, insulate and help in forming myelin sheath
    - PNS
        - Satellite Cells surround neuron cell bodies
        - Schwann Cells insulate and help in forming myelin sheath
- Longest lived cells in body
- Irreplacable
- Huge appetites
- Soma
- Process is a projecting part of an organic structure
- Polarity of neurons
    - Multipolar
    - Bipolar
    - Unipolar
- Anatomical Separation
    - Sensory neurons are usually unipolar and transmit info from body to CNS
    - Motor neurons are usually multipolar and transmit info from CNS to body
    - Interneurons or association neurons are usually multipolar, live in CNS and transmit impulses between sensory and motor neurons
