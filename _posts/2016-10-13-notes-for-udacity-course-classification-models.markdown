This is first in the series of notes that I plan to put online which I take during my online courses. This one specifically is from the Udacity Course Classification Models. 

The course start with a discussion around a problem where we need to predict which things people are more likely to buy with the change of weather. 

Lesson 1 -
* Discussion about examples of classification problems. For eg. determining if a soyabean has a disease or not using an image. 
* Discussion about binary(either of the two values) and non-binary(categorical variables) examples.
* Discussion about Statistical Terms - Target and Predictor Variable.
* Target Variable - Field we are trying to understand and predict - Dependent Variable. 
* Predictor Variable - Used to predict the target variable - Independent Variable. 
* Remove Duplicate Variables(one variable subset of other) identifying correlations. 
* Correlation - Measure of association between two variables whose vaues lie between -1 to 1.
* Three types of associations to be studied for understanding correlation 
	- 	Pearson correlation
	-	Spearman's Rank correlation
	- 	Hoeffding's Independent Test
* Pearson Correlation - Correlation Plots
	- 	No issues during training but issues while testing or predicting. 


Key take outs - <br>
* For those who are already aware of Machine Learning - Predictor Variable is what we call as a feature and Target Variable is the objective function.
