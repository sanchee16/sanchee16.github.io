Week 1:

- Understanding brain using computational models
    - Descriptive models of brain
        - Encoding (Study how neurons respond to stimuli) and Decoding (Important in field of brain computer interface) model of brain
    - Mechanistic models of brain
        - Simulate behaviour of single neuron
        - Simulate network of neurons
    - Interpretive or Normative model of brain
        - Understanding why the brain works the way it works
        - Study computational principles underlying a neuron
- Computational Neuroscience is the study of how brain generates behaviours
    - Characterising what nervous systems do ie descriptive models
    - Determining how they function ie mechanistic models
    - Understanding why they operate in particular ways ie interpretive models
- Receptive Fields 
    - Hubel and Wiesel Experiment with cats
    - Specific properties of a sensory stimulus that generate a strong response from a cell
- Descriptive models
    - Retinal Ganglion cells
    - Lateral Geniculate Nucleus
    - Center Surround receptive fields in retina
        - On center off surround
        - Off center on surround
    - Primary Visual Cortex
    - Cortical Receptive Fields ie oriented receptive fields
- Mechanistic models
    - Oriented receptive fields from center surround receptive fields
    - Multiple converging LGN cells info is captured by V1 cell
    - Above Hubel and Wiesel model does not take into account recurrent connections
- Interpretive models
    - Computational Advantages of receptive fields
    - Effiecient Coding Hypothesis
    - Image as linear combination of receptive fields
    - Optimization problem of minimizing squared pixel wise errors in reconctructed and actual images
    - Random RF and run efficient coding methods on images
    - Efficient Coding algos
        - Sparse Coding
        - ICA
        - Predictive Coding
- Neurons Doctrine
    - Neuron is fundamental structural and functional unit of brain
    - Majority are discrete cells
    - Info flows from dendrites to axons via cell body
    - EPSP (Excitatory Post Synaptic Potential)
    - When Summation of EPSP's surpases threshold then we have action potential
    - Node of Ravier
    - Leaky bag of charged liquid with a cell memberane made of lipid bilayer
    - Ionic Channels are proteins which are selective and embedded in memberanes to allow ions to flow in or out
    - Resting Potential of -70 mV because Na and Cl conc. is higher outside and K and organic Anions conc. higher inside
    - Ionic Pump maintains the potential by explelling K and allowing Na inside
    - Ionic channels are gated 
        - Voltage gated
        - Chemically gated eg synapses
        - Mechanically gated
    - Gated channels allow neuronal signaling 
        - Chemically gated channels change local membrane potential then voltage gated channels open/close
        - Depolarization(+ve change in voltage)
        - Hyperpolarization(-ve change in voltage)
    - Action Potential
        - Strong depolarization opens Na channels causing Na influx, more channels open and then they inactivate
        - Outflux of the K ions and then K channels also close
    - Myelination of Axons
        - Ensure flat long range spike communication
        - Saltatory Conduction is when action potential hops from one non-myelinated region (Node of Ravier) to another and ensures lossless signal propagation
        - In case of MS, the cell loses the ability to send action potentials
