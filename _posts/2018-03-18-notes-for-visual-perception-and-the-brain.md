Week 1:

- Can't explain perception which is the end result of vision
- Perception is what we are aware of
- Physical Measurements are objective
- Psychophysical Measurements are subjective
- Perception of Luminacnce
	- Relative Lightness
	- Measured with phonometer
- Spectrophotometer
- Geometry
	- Angle Perception
	- Motion Perception
	- Direction Perception
- Perception is at odds with reality
- Inverse Optics Problem ie no way of getting back the exact composition of retinal stimulus
- Inverse problems makes source of any image uncertain
- Source of Illumination
- 3D object surfaces
- Atmosphere
- Retinal Stimulus is compilation of
	- Illumination
	- Reflectance
	- Transmittance is the alteration of light by the atmosphere
- Visual Stimuli
- Light and Electromagnetic Radiation
	- Human visual system from 400 nm to 700 nm
	- To lower size range, the energy tends to damange cells
	- To greater size range, the energy tends to be present as heat
- Making an image
	- There is no image out there in the world just the mess of photons
	- Cornea orders out this photonic flux
- Eye
	- Cornea
		- Refractive Abilities
		- Refrative index is slightly greater than air
	- Retina
		- Part of brain
