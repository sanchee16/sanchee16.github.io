Week 1:

- Can't explain perception which is the end result of vision
- Perception is what we are aware of
- Physical Measurements are objective
- Psychophysical Measurements are subjective
- Perception of Luminacnce
    - Relative Lightness
    - Measured with phonometer
- Spectrophotometer
- Geometry
    - Angle Perception
    - Motion Perception
    - Direction Perception
- Perception is at odds with reality
- Inverse Optics Problem ie no way of getting back the exact composition of retinal stimulus
- Inverse problems makes source of any image uncertain
- Source of Illumination
- 3D object surfaces
- Atmosphere
- Retinal Stimulus is compilation of
    - Illumination
    - Reflectance
    - Transmittance is the alteration of light by the atmosphere
- Visual Stimuli
- Light and Electromagnetic Radiation
    - Human visual system from 400 nm to 700 nm
    - To lower size range, the energy tends to damange cells
    - To greater size range, the energy tends to be present as heat
- Making an image
    - There is no image out there in the world just the mess of photons
    - Cornea orders out this photonic flux
- Eye
    - Cornea
        - Refractive Abilities
        - Refrative index is greater than air
    - Lens is attached by zonule fibres
        - Involved in fine bending of light
    - Cilliary muscles contract or relax to change the shape of lens
    - Vitreous Humor
    - Optic Disk (Papilla)
    - Macula Lutea
    - Ophtalmic Arteries and Veins
- Eye Tracking
    - Saccadic Eye movements
- Retina
    - Interface between neural and non-neural parts of eye
    - Fovea
    - Pigment Epithelium
    - Photoreceptor Layer
        - Rods and Cones
    - Ganglion Cells are output layer cells
    - Bipolar Cells responsible for high resolution 
    - Amarcrine Cells responsible for capturing horizontal information 
- Light -> To Optic Nerve -> Ganglion Cell -> Amacrine Cell -> Bipolar Cell -> Horizontal Cell -> Rods -> Cones -> Photoreceptors -> Pigment Eplithelium
- Photo receptors have a high metabolic rate and discs on Pigment epithelium are turned over at high rate and are being degraded and need to be removed on an ongoing basis to function properly
- Distribution of rods and cones
    - Cones are concentated near and at the center of fovea
    - Rods are concentrated near the periphery of retina
- Cone function is one to one and rod function is many to one
- At absolute thrshold of vision rods operate and in bright sunlight cones operate and in moonlight both operate
- Primary Visual Pathway
    - Eye
    - Thalamus
    - Primary visual cortex
    - Superior Colliculus
        - Concerened with eye and head movements
- Autonomic Pathway
    - Pupilary Light Reflex
        - Concerned with pupil dilation
- Optic Chaism
    - Place where visual information crossing happens
- Tail flip effect
    - Information flipping and going on opposite side of brain
- Thalamus
    - Way station responsible for sensory organs
    - Lateral Geniculate Nucleus responsible for vision
        - 4 parvo-cellular layers concerned with full view vision, precision and color
        - 2 magno-cellular layers concerned with grosser change in the image or movement
- Retinotopy
    - Neighbour relationship of pixels of image
- Ganglion Cells of retina
    - parvo-ganglion cells
    - magno-ganglion cells
- PVC in occipital lobe
- Peak are gyri and valleys are sulci in the brain
- Optic Radiation are the optic fibres going from the the thalamus to Visual Cortex and vice versa
- Striate Cortex
