Prologue:
- Wind extinguishes a candle and energizes a fire. 
- Some things benefit from shocks, they thrive and grow when exposed to voltality, randomness, disorder, stressors and love adeventure, risk and uncertainity.
- Antifragile is beyond resilience or robustness. Resilient resists shocks, antifragile thrives from shocks. 
- Better to be dumb and antifragile than to be smart and fragile
- Love for certain types of errors
- NonPrediction:
	- Easier to ask if something is fragile than to predict an event which can harm it
	- Black Swan Problem is an unpredictable event that is beyond what is normally expected of a situation and has potentially severe consequences. 
		- Extremely rare, have severe impact, insistence of being obvious in hindsight
	- Detect antifragility through test of assymetry; Anything which has more upside than downside is antifragile; reverse is fragile
- Deprivation of antifragility:
	- Depriving systems of randomness weekens them and kills them ultimately.
	- Top-down is fragalizing where as bottom up under right amount of strss thrives.
	- Those trying to help are often hurting the most. Eg. Overprotective parents
- Upside at the expense of others:
	- Ethical rule - Thou shall not have antifragility at the cost of fragility of others
	- Non risk takers with no accountability exert so much control in today's world
	- Definition of hero has gone a 360 degree change
- Antidote to Black Swan:
	- Events are retrospectively explainable and hence the illusion of predictabililty
