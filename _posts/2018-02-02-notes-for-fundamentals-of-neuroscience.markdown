	- PNS (Peripheral Nervous System) contains peripheral nervous
- Neurons
- Complexity of brains


Course 1:

- Galvani and bioelectricity
- Volta and artificial electricity
- Neuron parts 
	- Cell body or Soma
		- Membrane Potential (-70 mV between inside and outside of membrane)
		- Outside part is considered Ground
		- Water, Proteins, Ions and Sugars
		- Key Ions (Na, Ca, K, Cl)
	- Axons and Dendrites
	- Lipid Bilayer (Cell Membrane)
- Resting Potential
	- Diffusion (Movement from regions of high concentration to low concentration)
	- Electrostatic force
