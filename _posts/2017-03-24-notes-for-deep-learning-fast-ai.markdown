Lesson 0:

- Incredibly flexible function (NN), all-purpose parameter fitting(Backprop), fast and scalable(GPU) made DL possible
- ?? before any function describes the function in Ipynb
- Shift + Enter in Ipynb
- Try things with your own data

Lesson 1:

- Infinitely flexible function, all purpose parameter tuning which is fast and scalable.
- NVIDIA GPU supports CUDA which is efficient in running deep learning computations.
- P2 and t2.micro
