        <title>Notes for Intro to Statistics!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the course offered by Sabestian Thrun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lesson 1:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using statistics he shows how we are actually less popular than our friends in expectation. This is actually called Friendship paradox.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;He tells how statistics plays a main role in coverting data to decisions and the fact that a good statistician spends a lot of time at looking the data.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is a discussion about scatter plot, linearity, outliers and noise and describes how bar charts address the issue of noise by merging points into single bar.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Notes for Neural Networks!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the course offered by Jeffery Hilton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Week 1:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;He starts with a dicussion about the need for machine learning models and talks about the situations where it is really hard to write programs and form rule based solutions since there is no single answer. Additionally, rules need to change and outsmart the ones who try to break the system.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Approach is to take examples and train the system using these inputs and outputs. Machine Learning algorithms take care of generalisation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learning algorithms are really good solutions for
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Recognising Patterns - Recognising facial expressions and identities.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Recognising Anomalies - Unusual Sequence of Credit Card Transactions.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Prediction - Future Stock Prices.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Discussion about MNIST databased of Handwritten Digits, ImageNet competition and Speech Recognition Task.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For speech recognition task, we have pre-processing, the acoustic model and decoding as various steps.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Talked about real neurons and how they insipred the development of neural networks as a field of machine learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Notes for Classification Model!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is first in the series of notes that I plan to put online which I take during my online courses. This one specifically is from the Udacity Course Classification Models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course start with a discussion around a problem where we need to predict which things people are more likely to buy with the change of weather.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lesson 1:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Discussion about examples of classification problems. For eg. determining if a soyabean has a disease or not using an image.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Discussion about binary(either of the two values) and non-binary(categorical variables) examples.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Discussion about Statistical Terms - Target and Predictor Variable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Target Variable - Field we are trying to understand and predict - Dependent Variable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Predictor Variable - Used to predict the target variable - Independent Variable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove Duplicate Variables(one variable subset of other) identifying correlations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Correlation - Measure of association between two variables whose vaues lie between -1 to 1.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Three types of associations to be studied for understanding correlation
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Pearson correlation&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Spearman’s Rank correlation&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Hoeffding’s Independent Test&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pearson Correlation - Correlation Plots
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;No issues during training but issues while testing or predicting.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key take outs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For those who are already aware of Machine Learning, Predictor Variable is what we call as a feature and Target Variable is the objective function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Welcome to my blog!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;First of all, thanks for visiting my blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think of this blog as my scratch book. A place where I can write about my experiences in personal and professional life. Remember the days we used to write diaries in the childhood as &lt;br /&gt;
Dear Diary, &lt;br /&gt;
  Today I did ……… &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog is the same dear diary - the only difference being this diary is open to all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier I thought that I will confine this blog to just tech related learnings and then I saw &lt;a href=&quot;http://hintjens.com/&quot;&gt;this blog&lt;/a&gt; and it gave me something I can never forget. Every time he mentioned about his last days he taught something important to me. All I can feel - he is so bold and he is making me learn something through his personal experiences of last days and so, I decided to eventually write my own personal experiences and make it open to all. May be someday; someone; reading my experiences will get the strength I got due to Pieter Hintjens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But to start, I am coming up with personal notes about a book I am currently reading these days. So, stay tuned since something interesting is coming up really soon.&lt;/p&gt;
